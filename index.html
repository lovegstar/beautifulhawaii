                <h2>The beauty of Hawaii</h2>
                <p>THERE’S NO SHORTAGE of natural beauty in Hawaii, from aquamarine beaches to majestic volcanoes. But to see it you have to look past all the human-built junk in the way: 46-story condos, 12-lane highways, and concrete viaducts blocking out the sun.
                Leah Schretenthaler makes taking in the Aloha State’s wonders a little easier in her series Invasive Species of the Built Environment. In it, she takes photographs of scenic attractions around Hawaii, prints the images, and laser-burns offending structures (and sometimes people) out of the way. “I really wanted to see how this land used to be,” she says. Hawaii’s development took off in 1959, when the 132-island archipelago became America’s 50th state and commercial jets began flying in tourists.

                <p><strong> Beachfront hotels</strong> (like the Ilikai of Hawaii Five-O fame), shopping malls, luxury high-rises, power plants, military training centers, freeways, and even telescopes went up—drawing ire from native residents and environmentalists, and leading to the oft-repeated joke that Hawaii’s state bird is the construction crane. (It’s actually the nene, a threatened species of goose.)</p>
